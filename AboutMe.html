  <h1>Jefford Y Lam</h1>
  <h3>Computer Science Student @ Hunter College</h3>

  <p>
    I am a current student at Hunter College majoring in Computer Science.
    I am open to gaining hands-on experience in areas such as database
    management using SQL and web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through both team projects and personal projects, I have developed
    experience in SQL database design, C++, and frontend development.
    This website serves as a portfolio of my work and ongoing projects.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of coding, I enjoy strategy-based hobbies such as trading card
    games and collaborative video games, which reinforce planning and
    long-term thinking.

  <h2>How I Track My Spending</h2>

  <p>
    I track personal expenses using a MySQL database that I designed myself.
    The data below is exported as JSON and displayed dynamically on this page
    using JavaScript. This reflects both my technical interests and my
    habit of organizing real-world data.
  </p>

  <table border="1">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Date</th>
        <th>Amount ($)</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody id="spending-table"></tbody>
  </table>

  <p id="total-spent"></p>
